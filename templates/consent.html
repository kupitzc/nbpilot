                        <li>You are being asked to participate in a research study to explore how memory and attention interact in three tasks.</li>
                        <li>You are eligible to participate in this study if you are at least 18 years of age or older and speak English.</li>
                        <li>The research procedures involve performing five short, similar tasks on your computer. In each task, you will view a stream of letters presented on the screen, and make judgments about each letter and its relation to previously presented letters. Each task will take approximately 7 to 9 minutes, and the entire study should take approximately 45 minutes in total, and should not take longer than 60 minutes. </li>
                        <li>Possible risks/discomforts associated with the study are minimal, past those of standard computer use. </li>

                        <li>There are no direct benefits from participation in the study. However, this study may add to our understanding of how memory and attention interact. </li>
                        <li>All research data collected will be stored securely and confidentially on a password protected server in a locked lab indefinitely. The data will not be connected to your identity in any way. Experiment data collected will be stored in an online public repository upon publication of any manuscript involving said data. Demographic data will be published as summary statistics (i.e., counts, averages, and standard deviations) only, and again, no personally identifying information will be collected or published. </li>
