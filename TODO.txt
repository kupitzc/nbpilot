SHORT-TERM TO DO / WHERE TO PICK UP:
	Finish timing controls, especially while allowing for responses the whole time
	Control stimulus order / generate N-back sequence properly
	Update the instructions / questionaire etc. to be accurate
	IRB
	




LONG-TERM PSITURK TO DO:
	Change from SQLite to MySQL
		Setup MySQL database to hold it (AWS? Other, here?)
		Test local MySQL configuration - for debugging purposes / to check that the data is collecting as we want it to
	Use 'routes' to do concurrent data collection on the server
		for both posterity, and data formatted more how I want it
	Make sure all the timing works.
		setInterval can call subfunctions, seems like a good idea
		

PSITURK ISSUES:
	Secure Ad Server can't play well with this computer
		Running the HIT on the workersandbox is error 1015 (no server I guess)
			Hmm, the psiturk 'system_status' page on the dashboard is 404
		Forum suggests this is because the ad server can't talk to this computer
			Recommended OpenShift as a solution
				Involves public SSH keys

	Psiturk dashboard for managing ads...
		Actions do nothing
		Action list is cut off (does not display properly)
			*oh my god this issue has been around for 2 years*
